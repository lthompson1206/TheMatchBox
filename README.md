TheMatchBox_store

Is a store that you can find your latest hair products, clothes, electronics, and snacks.
Here I made a database that is derived off of javascript.
In this app, a customer can buy and sell products on it.

Here is the customer's view of the menu:

Then here is where you choose if you want to buy or sell:

On the flip side, me as the owner/manager of the app can view the inventory, view how low it is, and add to the inventory. 
Below is the manager view:

If I wanted to add to any low inventory I have I can do this:
